            <p>Hey there! I’m Awel Kassim, a Full Stack Web 
            and Mobile App Developer with a strong focus
            on building fast, scalable, and user-friendly
            applications. Over the past few years, I’ve had the chance to work with
            a couple of tech companies where I gained hands-on 
            experience in developing full-stack solutions using modern
            tools and frameworks like React, Node.js, Express, Tailwind CSS, and React Native. 
            I’ve built everything from business websites to e-commerce platforms and mobile apps
            that are now live and used by real customers. I always follow clean 
            code principles, well-structured architecture,<br /> <br /> and best practices to make sure 
            the apps I build are easy to scale and maintain.
            I’m the kind of developer who enjoys understanding the real 
            goals behind a project—not just what the client asks for, but what
            the business actually needs to succeed. I treat every client like a partner and keep 
            communication clear with regular updates. I also care a lot about things that matter
             in the long run—like SEO, app performance, security, and accessibility. Whether I’m
            working on a mobile app or a responsive website, I always aim to deliver something that’s
           fast, secure, and ready to grow. And yes, I like finishing projects before deadlines whenever I can!</p>
